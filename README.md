# 📘 React Forms Practice Project

This repository contains a collection of form components I built during the early stages of my React learning journey. I re-uploaded this project after losing access to my previous GitHub account.

This project focused on understanding controlled components, state management, input handling, and validation logic — all implemented using core React features without relying on external form libraries.

## 🚀 About This Project

While learning React fundamentals, I wanted to deeply understand how forms worked under the hood instead of immediately relying on libraries like Formik or React Hook Form.

To achieve that, I built multiple form components from scratch using:

* useState
* Event handlers
* Controlled inputs
* Manual validation logic
* Conditional rendering

I intentionally avoided:

* ❌ Form libraries
* ❌ External validation packages
* ❌ Even the native `<form>` tag in some components

The goal at that time was to clearly understand how React handled input state, re-renders, and UI updates.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* React (Functional Components)
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* CSS3

## 🧠 What I Practiced

Through this project, I practiced and strengthened my understanding of:

* Controlled vs uncontrolled components
* Handling multiple input fields
* Managing form state efficiently
* Writing manual input validation logic
* Conditional UI rendering
* Event handling in React
* Understanding component re-renders
* Structuring reusable input logic

## 🎯 Why I Didn’t Use a Form Library

At that stage of learning, I wanted to first understand:

* How onChange events worked internally
* How React state updates triggered re-renders
* How manual validation logic could be implemented
* How form submission logic worked without abstractions

Building forms without libraries helped me build a strong foundation in core React concepts before moving to more advanced tools.

## ⚠️ Project Context

This project represented an earlier phase of my React development journey. It focused primarily on strengthening fundamentals rather than production-ready architecture or best practices.

---

## 🔥 What I Would Improve Now

If I were to revisit this project today, I would:

* Use semantic `<form>` elements consistently
* Implement more structured validation patterns
* Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
* Improve accessibility using proper ARIA attributes
* Add proper error handling and edge case management
* Write unit and integration tests
